Google-Homepage HTML and CSS Project: 

This is a warmup mini-project where I deconstruct google's homepage and rebuild it using HTML and CSS. 

Goals of the project are: 
- Conceptualize element placement on a page
- Using browser developer tools to perform page analysis and live editing
- Practice using Git workflow to manage a project
- Use html and css elements properly
